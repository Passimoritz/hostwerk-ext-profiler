# Profiler

Finds out why a page or app is slow: PHP profile with one click (Xdebug), Node and Python apps through the inspector or cProfile.

[Deutsch](README.de.md) · An official [Hostwerk](https://github.com/Passimoritz/hostwerk-public) extension (SDK 2.7, native extension)

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

## What it does

- PHP profile with one click (Xdebug)
- Node.js apps through the inspector, Python through cProfile
- The slowest functions and the share of the database
- Plain hints and an AI explanation
- History of earlier runs, tab “Performance” in every project

## Install

In Hostwerk: **Extensions → Discover** and click “Install”. If you already used this feature in Hostwerk 2.8, the update installs the extension by itself – with all your data.

Native extensions run as part of Hostwerk (own server and interface part). That is why Hostwerk only installs them from the official catalogue (with checksum) or in developer mode.

## Data

`data/profile` – exactly where Hostwerk always kept it. Removing the extension deletes nothing.

## Develop

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.js          # tests
node build-native.js .               # build the interface (sdk/build-native.js from hostwerk-public)
node check.js . --strict             # same check as the catalogue (sdk/check.js)
```

Interface source in `ui/src`, server part in `server/`. Texts in the code are English, German is in `locales/de.json`.
